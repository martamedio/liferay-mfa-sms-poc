# Liferay: Multi-Factor Authentication Verifier POC

This project adds a custom Multi-Factor Authentication Verifier on Liferay. It implements configuration, portlet and an identity checker using the architecture offered by Liferay DXP (7.3 onwards).

It has been used as an example in one online talk for the [Spanish Meetup LUGS](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Liferay-Spain-User-Group/events/274688318/).
